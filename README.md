# LostButFound
A project developed for a one day hackathon [iNTUition](https://intuition.ieeentu.com/). The project aims to leverage AI to identify and classify lost items found by other students in NTU in order to facilitate finding lost items.

# Abstract
Tensorflow Object Detection with Python was used in the identification of items through images. A flask server was used to build an API endpoint to utilize the model.

A React web application was developed for users to interact with the model by uploading their image for the model to identify. The classification identified by the model as well as other information are stored into Google Firestore Database.
